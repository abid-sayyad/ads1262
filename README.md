# ADS1262 Linux Kernel Driver

## Overview

This is the Linux kernel device driver for the **ADS1262**, a high-precision 32-bit resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) from Texas Instruments. The driver facilitates interfacing with the ADS1262 ADC via the Linux kernel, allowing for efficient data acquisition from multiple channels with both single-ended and differential input modes.

## Specifications

- **Channels**: The ADS1262 provides 10 analog input channels (0-9), plus an additional common analog input pin (AINCOM).  
- **Modes**: Supports both **single-ended** and **differential** ADC conversions, allowing for flexibility in measuring voltage differences between pairs of channels or with respect to a common ground.  
- **Resolution**: The ADC is based on a delta-sigma architecture and offers precision data conversion up to **32-bit resolution** across all input channels. This makes it suitable for high-accuracy applications such as sensor readings, industrial measurements, and scientific instrumentation.  
- **Interface**: The ADS1262 typically communicates over **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)**, which ensures fast and reliable data transfer between the ADC and the host system running Linux.  
- **Performance**: Delta-sigma ADCs like the ADS1262 are known for their excellent noise performance and stability in long-term measurement applications, providing reliable readings even in demanding environments.

For additional details, refer to the [ADS1262 datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1262.pdf).

## Driver Information

This driver is designed to integrate the ADS1262 into the Linux kernel, providing a seamless interface to access the ADC functionality through kernel-level I/O operations. The driver supports essential features such as:

- Configuring the ADC for both single-ended and differential conversions.
- Reading data from any of the 10 input channels.
- Handling precision timing requirements for accurate data capture.

### Key Features

- **Supports 10 input channels**: Access all 10 input channels, individually or in pairs for differential readings.
- **Configurable precision**: Leverage the full 32-bit resolution for applications requiring high accuracy.
- **SPI communication**: Efficient data transfer through the SPI protocol.
